## Description

### Overview

This tutorial shows how to use the Industrial Edge applications MELSEC Connector to establish a connection between an Industrial Edge Device (IED) and a 3rd party PLC that supports **MELSEC**. These PLC variants are supported:

* Mithsubhusi FX5U
* Mithsubhusi L02
* Mithsubhusi Q00U
* Mithsubhusi FX3U

The MELSEC Connector is an application that runs on the individual IED. Connections can be configured using the Common Configurator for industrial Edge. The connector transfers the value series of selected data points from a PLC to the Databus. From there the data can be used within other Edge apps, e.g. the Flow Creator.


### General Task

Here we configure a connection to a Mithsubhusi FX5U PLC using the Connector for MELSEC. The data is published on the Databus. By using the application Flow Creator, we fetch the metadata of the MELSEC Connector, write some data on the configured tags and the read out the new data.

## Installation

How to install/run this application example? (i.e. how to deploy it to Industrial Edge device?) How to build this application? How to set up configurations in IE?

To keep the readme.md file as short as possible please add more detailed information in the docs folder.

* [Build application](docs/Installation.md#build-application)

## Usage

When the app is installed, how can I use it? Usually some basic UI description to prove that the app is working correctly.

## Documentation

Add links to documentation. Either on external URL or in the doc folder. Please use always link to a file not to a directory (it doesn't work with static site generator engines).
