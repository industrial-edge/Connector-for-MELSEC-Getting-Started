## Description

### Overview

This tutorial shows how to use the Industrial Edge applications MELSEC Connector to establish a connection between an Industrial Edge Device (IED) and a 3rd party PLC that supports **MELSEC**. These PLC variants are supported:

* Mithsubhusi FX5U
* Mithsubhusi L02
* Mithsubhusi Q00U
* Mithsubhusi FX3U
* Mithsubhusi IQR

The MELSEC Connector is an application that runs on the individual IED. Connections can be configured using the Common Configurator for industrial Edge. The connector transfers the value series of selected data points from a PLC to the Databus. From there the data can be used within other Edge apps, e.g. the Flow Creator.


### General Task

Here we configure a connection to a Mithsubhusi IQR PLC using the Connector for MELSEC. The data is published on the Databus. By using the application Flow Creator, we fetch the metadata of the MELSEC Connector, write some data on the configured tags and the read out the new data.

## Configuration

You can find further information about the following steps in the [Configuration](/docs/Installation.md) documentation:

- [Overview](/docs/Installation.md#overview)
- [Install MELSEC Connector](/docs/Installation.md#install-melsec-connector)
- [Configure Databus](/docs/Installation.md#configure-databus)
- [Configure MELSEC via Common Configurator](/docs/Installation.md#configure-melsec-via-common-configurator)


## Usage

As soon as the MELSEC Connector is configured, data can be transfered.

You can find further information about how to handle the data via the Flow Creator in the [Usage](/docs/Usage.md) documentation:

* [Read metadata](/docs/Usage.md#read-metadata)
* [Write data](/docs/Usage.md#write-data)
* [Read data](/docs/Usage.md#read-data)
* [Use IIH essentials](/docs/Usage.md#use-IIH-essentials)
